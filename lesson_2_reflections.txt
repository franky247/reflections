What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git init
	a new git repository is created, but without any commits yet
	files are not yet tracked
	it creates the hidden .git subfolder

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	I can decide which files from the working directory will be added to a commit. This will be helpful when making sure that a commit related to one logical step.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I can add files one by one and commit these one by one, reflecting a logical change per commit
